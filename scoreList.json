            "review": "Holy schnitzel! yet another reboot!! I guess the main difference here is the fact they have actually tried to reboot a poor movie instead of a decent one. The quite unsurprising, yet still, truly gobsmacking and painful fact is Hollywood just doesn't get it, they just don't ever ever learn! I mean seriously, a child picks up things quicker than Hollywood. They are creating an adaptation of a popular videogame franchise, they know what has happened before, they know what people want, they know about the pitfalls, but somehow...some bloody how...they make all the same mistakes again. I here by present to you my review of 'Resident Evil 6: Agent 47'.So, there's this single agent bloke, he's a super soldier, assassin, clone, type bloke with all the trimmings you would expect. Speed, strength, agility, intelligence, super reflexes, bigger than average cock...the list goes on. The old bloke who created this project grew a conscience and ran off trying to hide the secret to creating these super soldiers. But guess what, some really evil nasty corporation wants the secret so they can make lots of these guys and conquer the world...or something like that. So the evil corporation goes after the daughter of the old bloke who started all this. At the same time, another mysterious corporation wants both the old bloke and his daughter whacked presumably to stop the secret falling into the wrong hands? They send in agent 47 in to do this, so they obviously control the only super soldier clone going and they wanna keep it that way.Now to look at this movie you'll see right away its slick, but slick in a predictable way. What I mean by that is...the Resident Evil movie franchise. Everything looks very glossy, very clean, very polished, with lots and lots of hi-tec computer screen readouts, security jiggery-pokery and top secret undercover assassin type net imagery, that all flashes about in front of you trying to impress you (but no monsters...even though, I'm sure they would have loved to). This world put simply, looks fake, plastic, sterile and way too obviously CGI. You can't immerse yourself within this world because it all looks so flippin' fake, I hate to say it but yes at times this movie does look like a videogame cutscene. There are some solid action sequences I won't deny, there are plenty of little snippets that naturally do service the fanboys of the videogame and rightly so. At times I liked what I saw because clearly there was some thought involved and decent choreography is evident, some nice gun fights and some nice fisticuffs, plus the main character (Rupert friend) is actually well performed and looks the part. The big problem is everything is completely let down by outrageously obvious CGI usage and ridiculously stupid action sequences which are in no way remotely believable. Yes I know this is a videogame adaptation hence you should suspend your disbelief, but that doesn't mean the movie has to be some kind of inane, gravity defying, realism defying CGI mess. Secondly, isn't the original game supposed to be based around stealth, lurking in shadows, taking people out silently...you know, discretion, acting like an actual assassin would. So why in blazes does agent 47 run around raining down carnage on everyone and everything without even pausing to take a piss, or maybe, just maybe, worry about the law, which apparently doesn't exist in this world. I mean, lets look at one very small sequence near the start where agent 47 escapes from the police (the one time we see them). He's in this locked room with guards and some gruff detective, or whatever, asking him questions. The detective puts 47's bigass sniper rifle on the table in front of him and questions him hard, eventually getting pissed off he loads it with one bullet and threatens to maybe shoot. 47 basically thanks him for bringing him his gun and loading it, he then kicks the underneath of the table which somehow causes it to fire whilst lifting it in the air. At the same time 47 raises his cuffed arm to allow the freshly fired bullet to break the chain and voila! he's free. The question is, what if that detective had never loaded the gun? or put the gun on the table? or even brought it in the room? then what?? huh???Apart from the nonsensical CGI shenanigans there are also many other obvious problems here. For a start the beginning of the pot is basically ripped off from 'The Terminator', its so bloody obvious! That's before it descents into boring, familiar, shiny white, sterile, baddie environments set within futuristic buildings (cough! Resi evil cough!). I also have to mention how none of it makes much sense (come on, you saw this coming surely). 47 changes his clothes a lot, a bloody lot! how does he have the time to do this?? how come everything he changes into looks custom made to fit him?? and most of the time it doesn't even feel relevant, its like they do it just to reference the game. I'm not too up on the videogame I'll be honest, I did play one of them way back, can't recall which, but I don't recall 47 ever speaking much. I realise you might require him to speak a bit but why not take the [i]Mad Max[/i] route here, or the Clint Eastwood 'man with no name' route, and not have him speaking much at all. Here he starts like that but eventually becomes like...this regular dude. At first he's this slow moving stalker type (walks everywhere yet always manages to catch up with his prey...eh?) who only mutters, by the end he's this smartass with a sidekick.Oh and what is the deal with the sidekick? Spolier alert she's an advanced agent too, because of course, and because you have to have a strong female role in everything these days or people lose their minds apparently. So she is better than 47, she is 90, see that means she's better because its a higher number. This lady agent has really heightened senses, which sounds plausible enough...but is it here? In this film she's apparently able to virtually see into the future from what I could make out, she can see exactly what's gonna happen plus she can regain shittonnes of backdated memory just by touching another persons hand like some kind of supernatural power.Lets not even begin to talk about how utterly useless and inept the baddies are in this, hordes of them armed to the teeth, yet no one can manage a single hit on the good guys, ugh! This genuinely looked quite good from outset, it really looked like they might have nailed it. In some aspects they have, generally visuals are crisp and exciting with nice videogame touches, but its just let down with so much tacky shit and some terrible acting (accept for Friend who wasn't too bad). This should of been a slow moving adult thriller with darkness and gritty realism, instead its just childish CGI packed nonsense, I really thought we had seen the last of movies like this.",

            "review": "Killing machines that can take out poor regular humans by the truckload, terminators, seem all the rage at the local cinema lately (I'm talking strictly on the screen unfortunately), and of the two recent forays into that genre I liked this one best simply because there was no beating around the bush: let's just get down to the business of wiping out sons-of-witches all over the place, no salt, no pepper, no questions. The body pileup, like a videogame, only misses the blood and bodies disappearing of their own accord that those types of adventure mediums specialize in. There's a story too but, really, is that necessary? It would only be unbelievable anyway, and this one does not fail in that regard. All of these films depend on one conceit: the bad guys all attack one at a time, quite unlike the truth one witnesses out in the real world where swarming is the rule of thumb, but I digress. Killing people, and killing lots of them? This is for you.",

            "review": "Hollywood seems fascinated with hitmen. Over the decades, hitmen have popped up fairly regularly in movies that have included sci-fi (\"The Terminator\"),contemporary thrillers (\"Collateral\"), fictional dramas (\"The Bodyguard\"), dramas based on true stories (\"The Iceman\"), dark comedies (\"In Bruges\") and even no-holds-barred juvenile comedies (the \"Dumb and Dumber\" movies). The hitmen's motivations usually involve money, but also range from political (\"The Gunman\") to brainwashed (\"The Manchurian Candidate\") to straight-up sociopathic (\"No Country for Old Men\"). The actors who embodied these characters have been of different degrees of celebrity (from Jean Reno to Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, Chow Yun-Fat, Keanu Reeves and even Tom Hanks), different races (\"Pulp Fiction\") and different genders (\"Point of No Return\"). 2015 offers us \"Hitman: Agent 47\" (R, 1:36) whose title character fits into several of these categories and is based on a video game series.This film represents the second attempt to bring the small screen CGI character to living-breathing reality on the big screen. A 2007 \"Hitman\" movie starred a pre-\"Justified\" Timothy Olyphant in the lead role and made quadruple its budget in the U.S. alone. A planned sequel was cancelled, partly because Olyphant wasn't interested in making the movie. In early 2013, a reboot was announced, with Paul Walker attached to play the lead. The role was re-cast a couple months after Walker's sudden death in late 2013. Filming of the reboot finally began in February 2014.In this American-German production, British actor Rupert Friend sheds his accent to play \"47\", a genetically-engineered hitman. He was part of a discontinued government program to turn children into adult assassins with heightened intelligence and physical capabilities, but without those hitman-hindering human qualities of fear and compassion. These agents don't have much in the way of personality, but they're extremely efficient and frighteningly lethal.The film remains mostly true to the main character of the same name in the \"Hitman\" video games. 47 (so named because of the last two digits in the bar code on the back of his neck) wears the character's usual garb, consisting of a black suit, white shirt and red tie. That is, unless he has knocked someone out and stolen his clothes in an effort to blend in with the environment, an ability that's enhanced by his always cool and confident demeanor.Still, this version of 47 is slightly more human than gamers are used to. Although he's basically as cold and calculating as the video game character, the film's 47 shows a little more of an ability to think for himself and sometimes betrays the faintest glimmer of humanity. Also, while still more efficient in the field than any flesh-and-blood assassin has a right to be, 47 isn't quite the perfect never-miss, never-lose agent that people familiar with the character may expect to see.47 is given orders for two hits by his handler, Diana (Hong Kong-based actress and model Angelababy). The first step in the mission involves finding Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), a young woman in Berlin who's tormented by feelings of fear and flashes of memory that she doesn't understand. It seems that Katia has ties to a Dr. Litvenko (Ciar\ufffdn Hinds) whose research created the Agent program in the first place. An international crime organization called \"Syndicate International\" is more than a little interested in re-starting that program, which also has them looking for Katia as a way of finding the good doctor. Katia has suddenly become a very popular person. 47 and an agent called John Smith (Zachary Quinto) catch up to Katia at the same time in a scene reminiscent of the T-800 and Kyle Reese simultaneously finding Sarah Connor in 1984's \"The Terminator\".There are more twists and turns in this movie's plot than a Cedar Point roller coaster, so, in my ongoing quest to avoid spoilers, I can only make some general statements about the rest of the story. Much of the film involves the cat-and-mouse game between competing organizations and those who support them. At stake is whether the Agent program will be able to restart and produce agents even more advanced than 47. This makes each group desperate to get to Litvenko before the other. Along the way, we see high-performance cars that would make the \"Fast and Furious\" gang jealous, both sides in this struggle utilize a variety of sophisticated and shiny weaponry and many people are killed, often in graphic and creative ways.Most of the critics don't like \"Hitman: Agent 47\", but I think their criticisms are misguided. No, this isn't the most original hitman film ever produced and yes, some of the plot points are predictable, but focusing on those two issues is kind of short-sighted. This movie is simply very well-done. The casting and acting is solid, the characters are interesting, the action is fun and the cinematography is great. The script is smart and digs a little deeper than most actioners. A recurring theme in the movie involves being in control of your own destiny, regardless of what has happened in your past. One such exchange between two characters goes like this: \"You can't fight against who you are. You'll lose,\" versus, \"We determine who we are by what we do.\" If you can handle the violence and don't insist on complete originality in your action movies, you're likely to enjoy \"Hitman: Agent 47\", whether you're a gamer or not. \"A-\"",

            "review": "Hollywood seems fascinated with hitmen. Over the decades, hitmen have popped up fairly regularly in movies that have included sci-fi (\"The Terminator\"),contemporary thrillers (\"Collateral\"), fictional dramas (\"The Bodyguard\"), dramas based on true stories (\"The Iceman\"), dark comedies (\"In Bruges\") and even no-holds-barred juvenile comedies (the \"Dumb and Dumber\" movies). The hitmen's motivations usually involve money, but also range from political (\"The Gunman\") to brainwashed (\"The Manchurian Candidate\") to straight-up sociopathic (\"No Country for Old Men\"). The actors who embodied these characters have been of different degrees of celebrity (from Jean Reno to Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, Chow Yun-Fat, Keanu Reeves and even Tom Hanks), different races (\"Pulp Fiction\") and different genders (\"Point of No Return\"). 2015 offers us \"Hitman: Agent 47\" (R, 1:36) whose title character fits into several of these categories and is based on a video game series.This film represents the second attempt to bring the small screen CGI character to living-breathing reality on the big screen. A 2007 \"Hitman\" movie starred a pre-\"Justified\" Timothy Olyphant in the lead role and made quadruple its budget in the U.S. alone. A planned sequel was cancelled, partly because Olyphant wasn't interested in making the movie. In early 2013, a reboot was announced, with Paul Walker attached to play the lead. The role was re-cast a couple months after Walker's sudden death in late 2013. Filming of the reboot finally began in February 2014.In this American-German production, British actor Rupert Friend sheds his accent to play \"47\", a genetically-engineered hitman. He was part of a discontinued government program to turn children into adult assassins with heightened intelligence and physical capabilities, but without those hitman-hindering human qualities of fear and compassion. These agents don't have much in the way of personality, but they're extremely efficient and frighteningly lethal.The film remains mostly true to the main character of the same name in the \"Hitman\" video games. 47 (so named because of the last two digits in the bar code on the back of his neck) wears the character's usual garb, consisting of a black suit, white shirt and red tie. That is, unless he has knocked someone out and stolen his clothes in an effort to blend in with the environment, an ability that's enhanced by his always cool and confident demeanor.Still, this version of 47 is slightly more human than gamers are used to. Although he's basically as cold and calculating as the video game character, the film's 47 shows a little more of an ability to think for himself and sometimes betrays the faintest glimmer of humanity. Also, while still more efficient in the field than any flesh-and-blood assassin has a right to be, 47 isn't quite the perfect never-miss, never-lose agent that people familiar with the character may expect to see.47 is given orders for two hits by his handler, Diana (Hong Kong-based actress and model Angelababy). The first step in the mission involves finding Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), a young woman in Berlin who's tormented by feelings of fear and flashes of memory that she doesn't understand. It seems that Katia has ties to a Dr. Litvenko (Ciar\ufffdn Hinds) whose research created the Agent program in the first place. An international crime organization called \"Syndicate International\" is more than a little interested in re-starting that program, which also has them looking for Katia as a way of finding the good doctor. Katia has suddenly become a very popular person. 47 and an agent called John Smith (Zachary Quinto) catch up to Katia at the same time in a scene reminiscent of the T-800 and Kyle Reese simultaneously finding Sarah Connor in 1984's \"The Terminator\".There are more twists and turns in this movie's plot than a Cedar Point roller coaster, so, in my ongoing quest to avoid spoilers, I can only make some general statements about the rest of the story. Much of the film involves the cat-and-mouse game between competing organizations and those who support them. At stake is whether the Agent program will be able to restart and produce agents even more advanced than 47. This makes each group desperate to get to Litvenko before the other. Along the way, we see high-performance cars that would make the \"Fast and Furious\" gang jealous, both sides in this struggle utilize a variety of sophisticated and shiny weaponry and many people are killed, often in graphic and creative ways.Most of the critics don't like \"Hitman: Agent 47\", but I think their criticisms are misguided. No, this isn't the most original hitman film ever produced and yes, some of the plot points are predictable, but focusing on those two issues is kind of short-sighted. This movie is simply very well-done. The casting and acting is solid, the characters are interesting, the action is fun and the cinematography is great. The script is smart and digs a little deeper than most actioners. A recurring theme in the movie involves being in control of your own destiny, regardless of what has happened in your past. One such exchange between two characters goes like this: \"You can't fight against who you are. You'll lose,\" versus, \"We determine who we are by what we do.\" If you can handle the violence and don't insist on complete originality in your action movies, you're likely to enjoy \"Hitman: Agent 47\", whether you're a gamer or not. \"A-\"",

They're the same length but this one feels way longer, not a good quality for a reboot, especially one that's decided to inject superpowers into the story.

Giving this video game franchise a second crack at the big screen, this is about everybody's favorite bald headed-assassin with a barcode on his neck, Agent 47 (Rupert Friend). He teams up with a mysterious woman with a clairvoyant touch (Hannah Ware), and together they do some digging into the history of her father. Now believe it or not, this is a property I know quite a bit about. I'm actually a big fan of the stealth video game series, and I could bend your ear about Contracts or Blood Money. That said, I do realize that there are things that should exist in one medium and not in the other, and with the Hitman property, I'm of the opinion that it should stay on the PlayStation, especially after this most recent attempt. While I do like Hitman as a video game, I have to say that these movies are as dumb as dirt. With the opening to this, you have an introduction so high tech and silly that it is almost like a Roger Moore James Bond film. While I will give this credit in that it at least moves pretty quickly, it's entirely style over substance. This is entirely insubstantial, and it doesn't matter if it makes sense or not, the director's chief concern was to ensure that it looks cool. From the way this is put together, the action sequences play like mini music videos, and it honestly wouldn't surprise me to hear if the director had that kind of specialty background. It really gets so ridiculous that we're at the point that there are Terminators in this universe, and if you try to pick this apart from a logic standpoint, you're going to risk giving yourself an aneurysm. While there is really not much of anything to recommend about this, I will give this movie credit in that it's short and it moves quickly. If it slowed down at any point, it would seriously outstay its welcome, but from a standpoint of glossy stylish brevity, I award a point or two. The biggest folly is that there are video game elements that don't translate, like the bar code on the back of this man's head, for example. Whenever they decide to make a video game movie, the makers run into this catch 22; if they don't include certain elements, they risk facing criticism from the fans of the game for nixing it, and if they do include it, you'll get movie goers questioning why it doesn't make any logical sense. Hitman: Agent 47 is a silly piece of fluff that you're not going to retain for long, and while you're still better off just rewatching L\ufffdon: The Professional for a hitman story fix, this isn't the worst thing you could take the time to watch.",

            "review": "A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.This is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.The money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.The other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.6/10",

            "review": "Status Update? Mission Failed.Trained and genetically engineered to be the ultimate killing machine, one agent will stop at nothing to put an end to a corporation's plans of creating an army of super assassins.Award-winning Polish music video director Aleksander Bach makes his debut to the big screen with his first full-length feature film, Hitman: Agent 47, a \"modern\" reboot of the infamous 2007 video game adaption Hitman. Is it just me, or does it feel kind of silly to be rebooting a mostly forgettable film that's not even that old yet? Not that I hated the original, but I certainly never had the craving to watch it ever again. Obviously this raises a pretty obvious question: why did I bother watching this new Hitman film in the first place? To be quite honest... I have no clue. I suppose I often feel the need to give critically panned films a fighting chance as some of these underdogs end up becoming some of my most loved flicks. Take Neil Blomkamp's Chappie or the hilariously epic '90s slapstick comedy Beverly Hills Ninja for instance. Nevertheless, I have to agree with the bulk of the critics this time around. Despite having an unquestionably talented cast, this latest action flick doesn't really offer enough memorable moments worth mentioning.Hitman: Agent 47 carries itself with cold and violent force, effortlessly keeping a straight face throughout, but that's not necessarily a compliment. Where the action sequences prevail, the yawn-inspiring script continuously sets things up for failure. Action without depth is like a grilled cheese without the cheese: dry, bland, and easily crumbles from its lack of integrity. Served with an unimpressive side of \"thin plot\" and a tall glass of \"0.5 % character development,\" Agent 47 clearly failed to satisfy this action enthusiast.Maybe if I would have played the video games that this film's loosely based on, I would have appreciated this live-action adaption a little more. Judging by most fans of the games themselves though, it sounds like they're genuinely disappointed with the misguided adaption of their beloved character, 47. Perhaps it's time studios give the green light only to directors who're actual gamers that have at least played the games the movies are based on. This certainly paid off in the recent Crackle original Dead Rising: Watchtower. But what's done is done, and from this poor attempt to reboot a potential Hitman film franchise, I'm betting we won't be seeing any sequels in the near future.",

Too unrealistic, with a story which is so bad that it could actually amuse, this attempt to reboot and to start a franchise of the same video game is nothing but a mindless action which goes fine only with excessive amount of beer and popcorns and deliberately lowered IQ (or attention towards the details).The story is about genetically improved assassins, who are part of a lost scientific research. When a secret organization tries to capture the daughter of the leading scientist and creator of these walking killing machines becomes a target. Agent 47 ( Rupert Friend) has to protect Katia (Hannah Ware) and to find her father as well. Needless to say the story is both banal and utterly predictable. There are several action sequences which would entertain and capture the attention but overall neither the story, nor the acting of Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware deserve any particular attention. A poor action flick, which would be forgotten shortly after the final credits, Hitman: Agent 47 is not a movie to be advised. Suitable only to see if there is nothing else to do or you have some time to waste and you would like to watch a no-brainer action .",

            "review": "Holy schnitzel! yet another reboot!! I guess the main difference here is the fact they have actually tried to reboot a poor movie instead of a decent one. The quite unsurprising, yet still, truly gobsmacking and painful fact is Hollywood just doesn't get it, they just don't ever ever learn! I mean seriously, a child picks up things quicker than Hollywood. They are creating an adaptation of a popular videogame franchise, they know what has happened before, they know what people want, they know about the pitfalls, but somehow...some bloody how...they make all the same mistakes again. I here by present to you my review of 'Resident Evil 6: Agent 47'.So, there's this single agent bloke, he's a super soldier, assassin, clone, type bloke with all the trimmings you would expect. Speed, strength, agility, intelligence, super reflexes, bigger than average cock...the list goes on. The old bloke who created this project grew a conscience and ran off trying to hide the secret to creating these super soldiers. But guess what, some really evil nasty corporation wants the secret so they can make lots of these guys and conquer the world...or something like that. So the evil corporation goes after the daughter of the old bloke who started all this. At the same time, another mysterious corporation wants both the old bloke and his daughter whacked presumably to stop the secret falling into the wrong hands? They send in agent 47 in to do this, so they obviously control the only super soldier clone going and they wanna keep it that way.Now to look at this movie you'll see right away its slick, but slick in a predictable way. What I mean by that is...the Resident Evil movie franchise. Everything looks very glossy, very clean, very polished, with lots and lots of hi-tec computer screen readouts, security jiggery-pokery and top secret undercover assassin type net imagery, that all flashes about in front of you trying to impress you (but no monsters...even though, I'm sure they would have loved to). This world put simply, looks fake, plastic, sterile and way too obviously CGI. You can't immerse yourself within this world because it all looks so flippin' fake, I hate to say it but yes at times this movie does look like a videogame cutscene. There are some solid action sequences I won't deny, there are plenty of little snippets that naturally do service the fanboys of the videogame and rightly so. At times I liked what I saw because clearly there was some thought involved and decent choreography is evident, some nice gun fights and some nice fisticuffs, plus the main character (Rupert friend) is actually well performed and looks the part. The big problem is everything is completely let down by outrageously obvious CGI usage and ridiculously stupid action sequences which are in no way remotely believable. Yes I know this is a videogame adaptation hence you should suspend your disbelief, but that doesn't mean the movie has to be some kind of inane, gravity defying, realism defying CGI mess. Secondly, isn't the original game supposed to be based around stealth, lurking in shadows, taking people out silently...you know, discretion, acting like an actual assassin would. So why in blazes does agent 47 run around raining down carnage on everyone and everything without even pausing to take a piss, or maybe, just maybe, worry about the law, which apparently doesn't exist in this world. I mean, lets look at one very small sequence near the start where agent 47 escapes from the police (the one time we see them). He's in this locked room with guards and some gruff detective, or whatever, asking him questions. The detective puts 47's bigass sniper rifle on the table in front of him and questions him hard, eventually getting pissed off he loads it with one bullet and threatens to maybe shoot. 47 basically thanks him for bringing him his gun and loading it, he then kicks the underneath of the table which somehow causes it to fire whilst lifting it in the air. At the same time 47 raises his cuffed arm to allow the freshly fired bullet to break the chain and voila! he's free. The question is, what if that detective had never loaded the gun? or put the gun on the table? or even brought it in the room? then what?? huh???Apart from the nonsensical CGI shenanigans there are also many other obvious problems here. For a start the beginning of the pot is basically ripped off from 'The Terminator', its so bloody obvious! That's before it descents into boring, familiar, shiny white, sterile, baddie environments set within futuristic buildings (cough! Resi evil cough!). I also have to mention how none of it makes much sense (come on, you saw this coming surely). 47 changes his clothes a lot, a bloody lot! how does he have the time to do this?? how come everything he changes into looks custom made to fit him?? and most of the time it doesn't even feel relevant, its like they do it just to reference the game. I'm not too up on the videogame I'll be honest, I did play one of them way back, can't recall which, but I don't recall 47 ever speaking much. I realise you might require him to speak a bit but why not take the [i]Mad Max[/i] route here, or the Clint Eastwood 'man with no name' route, and not have him speaking much at all. Here he starts like that but eventually becomes like...this regular dude. At first he's this slow moving stalker type (walks everywhere yet always manages to catch up with his prey...eh?) who only mutters, by the end he's this smartass with a sidekick.Oh and what is the deal with the sidekick? Spolier alert she's an advanced agent too, because of course, and because you have to have a strong female role in everything these days or people lose their minds apparently. So she is better than 47, she is 90, see that means she's better because its a higher number. This lady agent has really heightened senses, which sounds plausible enough...but is it here? In this film she's apparently able to virtually see into the future from what I could make out, she can see exactly what's gonna happen plus she can regain shittonnes of backdated memory just by touching another persons hand like some kind of supernatural power.Lets not even begin to talk about how utterly useless and inept the baddies are in this, hordes of them armed to the teeth, yet no one can manage a single hit on the good guys, ugh! This genuinely looked quite good from outset, it really looked like they might have nailed it. In some aspects they have, generally visuals are crisp and exciting with nice videogame touches, but its just let down with so much tacky shit and some terrible acting (accept for Friend who wasn't too bad). This should of been a slow moving adult thriller with darkness and gritty realism, instead its just childish CGI packed nonsense, I really thought we had seen the last of movies like this.",

If you have ever played, or even just looked at the damn boxes for the game, you will notice there are several scenes where they keep the camera on for longer than needed, just so you catch the vintage Hitman references.

            "review": "From a technical stand point, \"Hitman: Agent 47\" is probably the worst movie I've seen all year. But, from a comedy stand point, this is easily one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile!I needed this after the complete disaster that was \"Vacation\".The plot is basically \"Terminator 2\" if direct by Michael Bay and Owe Boll's love child after a long hard day of wanting to kill everyone. And is about as faithful to the games as much as \"Home\" or \"Vacation\" were to their source materials.(For the record, I haven't played the games, but I have seen a bit of them through Let's Plays).But what pushes this movie above those two, is just, how much it does not give a single shit about ANYTHING logic or Physics, there are scenes, that are just so god damn stupid, it had me in tears I was laughing so hard, (The Airplane Factory scene is single handily the funniest thing I've seen in years).I mean, who could forget such memorable and hilarious moments as the Hitman using a Bible to slap someone across the face?Or when he straight up bitch slaps the camera? Or a woman untying herself from a chair in slow motion, with no expression on her face as she's slowly being sucked into a jet engine? Or when a random guy falls into a comically large grinder in an airport factory, WILHELM SCREAM AND ALL!Or Rupert Friend's Oscar worthy Shaved head and face? This guy is trying his hardest to sound and look cool, but he fails so epicly that its outstandingly terrible.And the actors are trying so hard to play this terrible dialogue so straight that it result in some of the most unintentionally hilarious acting I've seen in a while. And god damn, the effects.....oh good lord. Sometimes they're actually not that bad, the the CG........oh my. Its a sight to behold! Plus its home to one of the worst CGI car flip scenes I've ever seen. But it had me in tears.I know I'll probably lose all of my respect as lover of film for doing this, but I can not help but love just how god awful this movie is. I know by supporting this we won't get any good Video Game movies, but next year might be different.So as it is, just grab some popcorn, one of your favorite drinks, lobotomize yourself to the point where you have the mentality of a newborn, and just enjoy the atrocious hilarity that this movie has to offer.

            "review": "A pathetic, re-attempt at bringing the iconic video game character to the big screen with an even dumber plot than the last film and some of the worst special effects I've seen in a modern, action film in quite some time. The new actor playing Agent 47, Rupert Friend, does an okay job at looking the part, but he's barely given anything to do, and for a large portion of the film is actually portrayed as the villain, hunting a man and woman a la, The Terminator. Once the film shifts and the woman discovers that he's actually trying to protect her, it becomes nearly a carbon-copy of the original film with only minor differences. The story is completely uninteresting with a recycled plot you feel you've seen a million times and Zachary Quinto's, antagonist role is basically a cyborg with synthetic skin who can't be killed by bullets/knives and he just can't deliver a menacing performance. For some un-godly reason, the studio hired a music video director to helm the film and the same goddamn, terrible, shit-fuck writer from the last film, Skip Woods, who's literally the worst screenwriter in Hollywood and has delivered us such gems as X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Die Hard 5, Sabotage, and The A-Team...good choice guys. This film is almost nothing like the source material video game with tons of over-blown shoot-outs/car chases and features next to no stealth whatsoever; only mirroring the video games with his changing of disguises. There is some enjoyment to be had in some of the over-the-top death scenes as the film is gleefully R-rated and shows you every bit of it, but on the other hand, nearly every car crash/explosion/stunt is 100% computer generated and it looks TERRIBLE. This film is further proof that video games belong on their respective consoles and this series needs to be laid to rest.",

I am a bit reluctant to go that far, as I always keep in mind other movies that may not be in the genre but were great. For me, you can't give a 9 to both hit-man and LOTR. It may as well be that in their genres they're both great, but you just can't put them on the same level overall. As far as the movie is concerned, I really enjoyed the transfer from the game to the big screen. The graphics were all there and some of the movements were really mapped to the game, which brought too many WOW moments for both myself and my brother that watched it with me. We are both fans of the hit-man games and it was a real pleasure to watch this.We were not expecting as much from the movie. We actually wanted to watch the fantastic four but we were advised not to, so we went with the first alternative and were not at all disappointed. We were actually thrilled! The adaptation for the movie was phenomenal and some of the impossible scenes did not seem as implausible as in other movies. They did not throw you out of the movie by making you think \"what a big fat lie!\". It happened once or twice but not more. The lead actor was amazing in his role and it really felt like the real thing. He could have been picked to be a bit more long-faced and with narrow characteristics, more Asian-like, but still he was an excellent fit to what we saw in the game. To address some comments, agent 47 is not a pumped up freak on steroids, he's a silent assassin. Get your facts straight first and then judge. I also liked the lady (which was actually far by a sidekick as some suggested) that played a major role in the movie and that it seems that she will be the main character of the next movie, if one comes out. Nice, quiet, introverted but strong, beautiful as hell but no silicone, gym freak that looks unnatural. Someone that the ladies can relate to, which helps with the female target group of the movie I guess. The plot was OK, again based on what we knew from the game. If you played hit-man, you will adore the movie. It's one of these pleasant flashbacks, bundled into a quality piece of work overall.",

            "review": "As we wait for the day where a good video game movie will fall from the heavens and on to our movie screens, we have to sit through pieces of shit like Hitman: Agent 47. This isn't just a bad adaptation of a video game, it is just simply a terrible movie. This was a complete borefest from start to finish with a few cool looking scenes occasionally. And to make it even better, it had literally nothing to do with the actual Hitman games, why not just give it some other shitty name instead? By giving it the name 'Hitman' most people don't think of the popular video game, most people think of the 2007 adaptation, and trust me, you don't want people to relate your new film to that one.The main problem with the movie was how dull it was, every damn scene was completely lifeless, emotionless and some of the most unexciting stuff i've seen all year. Even the action, that is supposed to be fast paced and exciting was terribly boring. Some of it looked cool but thats all it had going for it. When an 'Action' film can't capitalise on the 'Action' it is destined to fail, and you have to wonder if these people know how to actually make a movie. Then you look at the director and realise that this is the ONLY FILM HE HAS EVER DIRECTED, EVER, and he hasn't even been involved in any other films...... WTF? But hey, he's directed some music videos........ that counts..... right? You can even see it in the film, the way it is put together is really sloppy, the pace is all over the place, and the whole film is incredibly generic. Even the plot of the film is just terrible, predictable and borrows crap from other films. It wasn't interesting in any way whatsoever, and oh man the dialogue was an abomination. It was bland, emotionless and almost like they were reading off a prompt on set. You know what this felt like? It was in part just a rip-off of Terminator 2 without the time travel and SkyNet, except in this case everything was poorly executed.The acting was really, really bad. There was no life at all to these characters, you don't like any of them, and because of that you aren't rooting for anyone. I don't know if \"be dull and boring' was the advice they were given, but if it was then hey, great job guys. The weirdest character has to have been the main heroine, Katia played by Hannah Ware. She had no character arc throughout and wasn't really developed or introduced in any way that explained her abilities. She also has some random sudden personality change late in the film that was out of no-where and made no sense at all. She has no chemistry with Rupert Friend and when half the movie was depending on that, it really showed. In the end this movie was dumb, dull and downright boring. There was no fun, no excitement, the action looked kinda cool and i guess was well choreographed but wasn't entertaining to watch. And to top it all off, it had nothing to do with 'Hitman' so this film is just packed with disappointment for everyone. - 3.2/10",

The films running time was good short and sweet not to long not to short and how 47 killed people was really good and identified how gory the hitman games were. The things I didn't like about the film was the script and Zachary Quinto could of been a better villain if it wasn't for the script, the other thing was the flight scenes, they were really sloppy, when i heard about this film i through the fight scenes would be as good as Jason Stathams one or even the ones from the film the Raid but inserted we got was fast paced CGI bullshit. over all this film is a fun ride but it could of been 10 times better.",

            "review": "Hitman: Agent 47 isn't able to hit one mark right, 26 September 2015*** This review may contain spoilers ***Ever wondered why movies based on video games that are best sellers actually fail to achieve same level of financial success?The answer is very simple; the audience that plays those games isn't coming to watch the movie. Like an imagination developed by a book-reading cannot be replaced by a visual art, likewise audience who are engaged in playing video games can never actually understand the soul of movie making. With a video game their own thoughts is the center of their attention. How can we ask such a mind frame to focus on watching someone else's point of view on the material they weren't looking forward to understand but rather play and make more score?Why I have raised the question above is that now I can explain why I loved the original The Hit-man (2007) movie that came out in 2007. I never played the video game and I am sure neither did the audience that came to theatres and made it a financial success. Lot of critics panned it due to its slow pace and not being so much like the video game. But that was the best part of 2007 movie. It used the character of the video game as a metaphor. Not replicate it exactly like to be him. They showed what makes him a silent killer. These games were about stealth and strategy and The 2007 Movie presented that in couple sequences like one in the restaurant and the ending church scene. Those scenes were classic example to present that strength of The Hit-man's intelligence and skills. This new 2015 movie boasts so much about brains and Agent 47's (Rupert Firend) skills, but shows none of it. In fact he so stupid that he risks taking out his targets by entering US Embassy and getting locked in an interrogation room, giving out his name, his face and then escaping in thin air as UNKNOWN SILENT KILLER, huh!Why they needed to re-write the story of The Hit-man (2007) and make a reboot within 10 years of first one. I think for some stupid commercial reason. There has to be something better they think can be done from the previous one. This one is a waste of money on all accounts, story, action sequences, visual effects and actors. The surprises are so ridiculous that you ask yourself, why we need Agent 47 now? we might as well entertain ourselves with the better version of his as shown in the movie. By the way I am not talking here about the John Smith (played by Zachary Quinto) villain character but The Girl (Hannah Ware) who seems to be scared for the whole of the movie then suddenly turns into super skilled killing machine. This movie would have been much better as stand-alone not focusing, yet again, to supersede its predecessor. This new one was trying to get to the point of showing flashy gun play sequences. Which neither connects to video game style of action nor matches two seconds of fun we have experienced earlier this year with John Wick (2015). That Keanu Reeves movie was a pleasure from beginning till the end, and I think in its own way The Hit-man (2007) was an amazing movie in the genre. It was a perfect story of a silent killer whose name is not known, who sees things around him that he feel like getting attached to, but something in his genes stop him from doing so. Hit-man: Agent 47 (2015) is a serious waste of time. We would rather like more Lucy (2014), Taken (2008), District B-13 (2004) type of stuff. All of them ridiculous, but entertaining within its own boundaries.",

In fact I actually found it entertaining, this film just takes itself too seriously.The acting is terrible and the story makes no sense. For example the character of Agent 47 walks and does things as slowly as possible and only occasionally breaks into a run. This bit bothered me so much that in one key scene he actually walks from one location up at least five or six flights of stairs and ends up having a perfect sight of a car he wants to shoot into, despite the car being faster and speeding. What did the car decide to pause so that the Hitman could walk up the stairs? This being said, the action scenes were mildly entertaining as the Hitman eviscerates his opponents who are not Zachary Quinto.Not one person truly cracks a smile in this film. Still it somehow managed to be a little better than the first film even if it wasn't by much. There's a twist ending which is just plain stupid, but it keeps with the tone of the film.I have walked out of films which are better than this, so to not walk out of this film shows that one this while being terrible isn't a complete waste of time, if you are looking for something to watch with your brain on neutral.

Those who are going to see this movie who are fans of the Hitman video game franchise, and those who want to go and see this as an action movie.The Hitman video game franchise: Rating this movie for what it's solely based off, I would give it a 3 out of 5. Why? The movie combines hidden (and sometimes noticeable) references to the franchise; all the way from hiding bodies to disguises. Yes, there is A LOT of action. However, there are elements of stealth involved in the movie. If you love the video game franchise, you might want to go and see this film.For an action movie: This is by far one of the most fun and enjoyable action movies I have ever seen! The action sequences and stunt work of the movie makes your next 1 hour and 25 minutes exciting and thrilling! Yes, the CGI is quite crap in some areas. This though is glossed over by a relatively decent and solid plot, a group of actors who portray their roles incredibly well and above all, fantastic use of the cinematography.Overall: 4/5. Before you start moaning about how it isn't similar to the games, I suggest going and watching it for yourself. I was quite surprised at just how good the film was.",

The body pileup, like a videogame, only misses the blood and bodies disappearing of their own accord that those types of adventure mediums specialize in. There's a story too but, really, is that necessary? It would only be unbelievable anyway, and this one does not fail in that regard. All of these films depend on one conceit: the bad guys all attack one at a time, quite unlike the truth one witnesses out in the real world where swarming is the rule of thumb, but I digress.

Hitman: Agent 47 is one of those movies where I watch hoping that the film makers have put in some form of effort to deliver a decent movie even when all signs(marketing,past track record etc) are pointing towards the movie being terrible. Unfortunately Agent 47 ends up being worse than I imagined failing to even provide some decent popcorn entertainment. Firstly, I don't understand why the studio asked Skip woods to write this movie again when he didn't deliver with the 2007 Hitman movie. This to me seems like they weren't even trying to provide a decent product. My biggest complaint with this movie is that the action scenes are shot terribly with the quick cut multiple angle bullshit that makes it extremely hard for you to follow the action. It seems that the director is trying to make it look stylish but it just comes off as annoying. There is nothing compelling in the world Hitman is set in and the movie just beats you over the head with tons of exposition that you simply can't care about. Rupert Friend does his best with the material he's given and he is a pretty good Agent 47 but I really don't think Hitman translates well from a video game to Movie. The best thing about the Hitman Video game franchise is the multiple ways a player can choose to tackle a scenario and this simply can't be transferred onto the big screen. Hitman is also at its best when he's stealthily killing targets but there is only one minor stealth sequence which was probably the best action setpiece the movie had to offer. The way Singapore was introduced in this movie was absolutely cringeworthy and that scene just showcases how bad the writing in this movie is. Its also hilarious how Agent 47 mostly walks behind his targets as if he is slender man and there is even a scene where he stands from a distance watching his targets which made LOL. The ending is a complete sequel bait ending and I have no interest in watching the sequel as there is nothing interesting this world has to offer. Looks like we still got to keep waiting for a good video game to movie adaptation. Fingers crossed for The Last of US. D-",

The first part of the film is basically Terminator with out the time travel but atleast showed promise. The second act basically was a cheap rip off of the Bourne identity and the dialogue really starts to go down hill. The third act goes a whole different direction and pretty much ends like every clich\ufffdd acti0n movies from the 90's and then abruptly ends with a terrible ending.Agent 47 played by Rupert Friend was a decent enough Hitman whenever he wasn't talking, he looked the part well enough and had a good enough screen presence but just couldn't deliver a believable line to save his life.The female lead, Hannah Ware, was hot enough and showed decent range but could only show so much especially having to deliver terrible dialogue.Zachary Quinto really phoned it in for this one, he usually brings it in Star Trek and has been an amazing talent since Heroes but this performance just fell flat.There wasn't much anticipation for this film especially seeing how it was a first time director and a hack of a writer in Skip Woods, need less to say I wasn't expecting an award winning classic but for the budget the director had to work with , he did a pretty decent job delivering a half way decent action flick.I wouldn't run to the theater to catch this jewel, instead I would wait for VOD or the Redbox for this one.

Did they start shooting before writing a scenario or what? That voice over at the beginning didn't make any sense and was way too long. The film jumps from scene to scene without making much sense visually or narratively. And then come the killer, the machine engineered to kill. Well fuck me guys... first the actor looks like a total gay underground leather daddy with as much charisma as a potato chip. I'll have to watch the film in its entirety at some point because the trailer displayed some amazing action scenes but I doubt it will happen soon. The first ten minutes scared me to death so sitting through an hour and a half of this will definitely be an experience from which I am not sure I will recover fully. My goodness how can one turn a film so badly shot and done? It really makes me sad because I love this type of films but boy did they underestimated their audiences.",

            "review": "\"Hitman: Agent 47\" is a 20th century fox movie based on a video game series of the same name. In the movie, a government organization and a team of scientists have engineered a mutant-like genome of human beings; one that are bred to be killing machines that kill without remorse or feeling. Agent 47 aims to protect the daughter of one of the original scientists from being captured, as a rogue organization called The Syndicate wants to procure her father's research to make an army of agents. While I admit that I could sit through this film, it felt very lackluster in parts, almsot as though the plot dragged. It was far less resonant than it needed to be, and the low-budget special effects do not help the movie's case any further. There is a semblance of a plot; but just that, it is very ramshackle at best and pieces of a plot rather than a tangible one. The action drives the movie, and I wish there had been more character development and story to put some meat on the bones here. I can't help but feeling like this is a dull video game adapation to movie with uninspired directing and pedestrian acting. If the movie wasn't so damn boring in parts and uneven it might have been something ---------------------------------------------------------- C",

There is also a Red Audi Quattro in the movie that I caught myself drooling over. But, other than that... I'm not sure this is a show many will find to be in anyway redeemable. It is slick and futuristic. There are bullets and bodies and bodies and bullets. The story evolves as a plot to build the perfect assassin. And in the course of that effort -- a maladjusted business type sees the potential for personal profit. Oh yes -- and a creepy dad is reunited with his children. It's a big fat mess -- that I didn't hate as much as a should. And did I mention that Red Audi Quattro. There is more than enough to find distasteful in Agent 47. Yet, I didn't leave the theater feeling cheated. Perhaps it was my low expectations. Or, more likely, it was being at the movies with my pal Bennett. He got a kick out of it.

Do people remember the Resident Evil franchise? Of course you do, because they're still making those terrible films! That is a video game adaption that most certainly didn't and doesn't deserve a movie franchise. Not to mention the horrific BloodRayne trilogy of movies. I say good job on the movie, and I truly hope to see a sequel. I'm not saying the movie doesn't have its faults, I mean what movie doesn't? Hopefully most of you out there don't listen to all these insanely critical reviewers, and you give the movie a chance to form your own opinion. 47 and the beloved video game series deserve at least that.",

            "review": "Hollywood seems fascinated with hitmen. Over the decades, hitmen have popped up fairly regularly in movies that have included sci-fi (\"The Terminator\"),contemporary thrillers (\"Collateral\"), fictional dramas (\"The Bodyguard\"), dramas based on true stories (\"The Iceman\"), dark comedies (\"In Bruges\") and even no-holds-barred juvenile comedies (the \"Dumb and Dumber\" movies). The hitmen's motivations usually involve money, but also range from political (\"The Gunman\") to brainwashed (\"The Manchurian Candidate\") to straight-up sociopathic (\"No Country for Old Men\"). The actors who embodied these characters have been of different degrees of celebrity (from Jean Reno to Brad Pitt, Liam Neeson, Sylvester Stallone, Chow Yun-Fat, Keanu Reeves and even Tom Hanks), different races (\"Pulp Fiction\") and different genders (\"Point of No Return\"). 2015 offers us \"Hitman: Agent 47\" (R, 1:36) whose title character fits into several of these categories and is based on a video game series.This film represents the second attempt to bring the small screen CGI character to living-breathing reality on the big screen. A 2007 \"Hitman\" movie starred a pre-\"Justified\" Timothy Olyphant in the lead role and made quadruple its budget in the U.S. alone. A planned sequel was cancelled, partly because Olyphant wasn't interested in making the movie. In early 2013, a reboot was announced, with Paul Walker attached to play the lead. The role was re-cast a couple months after Walker's sudden death in late 2013. Filming of the reboot finally began in February 2014.In this American-German production, British actor Rupert Friend sheds his accent to play \"47\", a genetically-engineered hitman. He was part of a discontinued government program to turn children into adult assassins with heightened intelligence and physical capabilities, but without those hitman-hindering human qualities of fear and compassion. These agents don't have much in the way of personality, but they're extremely efficient and frighteningly lethal.The film remains mostly true to the main character of the same name in the \"Hitman\" video games. 47 (so named because of the last two digits in the bar code on the back of his neck) wears the character's usual garb, consisting of a black suit, white shirt and red tie. That is, unless he has knocked someone out and stolen his clothes in an effort to blend in with the environment, an ability that's enhanced by his always cool and confident demeanor.Still, this version of 47 is slightly more human than gamers are used to. Although he's basically as cold and calculating as the video game character, the film's 47 shows a little more of an ability to think for himself and sometimes betrays the faintest glimmer of humanity. Also, while still more efficient in the field than any flesh-and-blood assassin has a right to be, 47 isn't quite the perfect never-miss, never-lose agent that people familiar with the character may expect to see.47 is given orders for two hits by his handler, Diana (Hong Kong-based actress and model Angelababy). The first step in the mission involves finding Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), a young woman in Berlin who's tormented by feelings of fear and flashes of memory that she doesn't understand. It seems that Katia has ties to a Dr. Litvenko (Ciar\ufffdn Hinds) whose research created the Agent program in the first place. An international crime organization called \"Syndicate International\" is more than a little interested in re-starting that program, which also has them looking for Katia as a way of finding the good doctor. Katia has suddenly become a very popular person. 47 and an agent called John Smith (Zachary Quinto) catch up to Katia at the same time in a scene reminiscent of the T-800 and Kyle Reese simultaneously finding Sarah Connor in 1984's \"The Terminator\".There are more twists and turns in this movie's plot than a Cedar Point roller coaster, so, in my ongoing quest to avoid spoilers, I can only make some general statements about the rest of the story. Much of the film involves the cat-and-mouse game between competing organizations and those who support them. At stake is whether the Agent program will be able to restart and produce agents even more advanced than 47. This makes each group desperate to get to Litvenko before the other. Along the way, we see high-performance cars that would make the \"Fast and Furious\" gang jealous, both sides in this struggle utilize a variety of sophisticated and shiny weaponry and many people are killed, often in graphic and creative ways.Most of the critics don't like \"Hitman: Agent 47\", but I think their criticisms are misguided. No, this isn't the most original hitman film ever produced and yes, some of the plot points are predictable, but focusing on those two issues is kind of short-sighted. This movie is simply very well-done. The casting and acting is solid, the characters are interesting, the action is fun and the cinematography is great. The script is smart and digs a little deeper than most actioners. A recurring theme in the movie involves being in control of your own destiny, regardless of what has happened in your past. One such exchange between two characters goes like this: \"You can't fight against who you are. You'll lose,\" versus, \"We determine who we are by what we do.\" If you can handle the violence and don't insist on complete originality in your action movies, you're likely to enjoy \"Hitman: Agent 47\", whether you're a gamer or not. \"A-\"",

            "review": "This movie does get the big key things of action right. However, it gets too many of the details wrong to be truly enjoyable. The plot is predictable, but does have the traditional twists and turns we have come to expect from a \"man against the system\" style action movie. The big action is wonderfully over the top, and there are plenty of cringe worthy bad guy death moments to pull you right in.However, the minor details it gets wrong will be enough to pull most people right back out again. CGI is used too liberally and in places where no CGI should actually be used. When Agent 47 was fighting on the train and train tracks with John Smith for example, the fall that lead up to that fight was cartoon-esque CGI. The actors monumentally turned into play-do people. Was hiring a couple stunt men to fall onto a train that expensive? Also when the men where firing hooks into the car (you know, the scene from the trailer?) they where anchoring their cables to the building with, you guessed it, CGI hooks and rings. How expensive would it have been to actually hook a line to a building in that scene? You don't even need to show the entire cable. Just one side hooked to a building in one scene, and then the other side hooked to the car in another. That way it doesn't look like we should expect Scooby Doo to burst onto the scene at any moment.The Hannah Ware's acting is just bad enough to continually remind you that you are watching a movie and not actually in the action. Her deadpan delivery of lines is just this side of emotional many times, and occasionally left me wondering how she got the job. I shouldn't go see a movie and feel like I can act better than the guys on screen, especially a leading part. When that happens, no matter the genre, you've failed at your job.If you can over look these two flaws than you will definitely enjoy this movie. However, if you prefer a plot that's not as predictable, better acting, and less CGI use, you might want to spend your hard earned cash elsewhere.",

The only time there's \"too much action\" in a film is when its repetitive, which means boring. I suppose it would be lame if nobody ever said anything at all. And it was JUST action. So i draw the line there.I like movies 90% action 9% plot 1% character development.Do i really care if agent 47 likes chocolate when he was 9? NO.I care about him doing cool things.I have seen reviews with 1 star and one reason is because of the criticism of the main character being \"dull\". HES SUPPOSED TO BE!He had the emotions taken out so he could be a more effective killer. And the fact that the actor did this SUCCESSFULLY is a problem?What is wrong with people.Another reason for not liking it is because of the \"damsel in distress\" complaint.So i guess you hate all the old Disney movies where the knight comes to save the princess via sleeping beauty.I guess there is something \"evil\" about the idea that a man can show his love for a woman by putting his life on the line for her.- Oh boy what a jerk.Its that evil patriarchy again ruining your enjoyment in films.Except for the fact that the damsel in this movie is said to be MORE powerful than the lead guy. (and not just a LITTLE more powerful, but agent 47 compared to her is ANT feces hes not even worth being in the same room as her)SO the fact that he rescues her initially to get the story going is still a problem for them regardless if shes actually BETTER than the male lead.Yes. lets just conveniently IGNORE this to promote the feminist agenda.Good idea.Whats wrong with people.For people complaining about dialogue and lack of plot and character development GO WATCH A DRAMA and not a ACTION FILM.Its like the people who go watch horror films and complain about being scared or the scenes of blood and gore. I do that sometimes too, you know i order a chocolate shake and im surprised that it doesn't taste like vanilla so i get mad and throw the cone on the floor.If i wanted character development id go watch a chick flick and puke in the isles.Except i wouldn't goto a chick flick and then complain about the lack of action like people on here are doing.\"oh i wanted to give it a chance!\" they said. No. You should stay home and stop wasting your money on movies you think are going to have stuff in them when you pretty much know they wont.I think ill go watch a g rated low budget documentary next week and expect to see a ton of high quality special effects with A list celebrities and plot and nudity.

            "review": "Underneath the disguise of flashy cinematic and noise effects, Hitman: Agent 47 is sadly, still a misfire of corny script and abysmal plot. As an action flick, it's certainly brimming with cool choreography as characters partially dance and partially John Woo dive their way through hail of bullet. Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical and inconsistent. It's understandable that the team wanted to create larger than life plot, but the process needs more delicacy than taking small scenes of the game and throws a bunch of popular gimmicks from Terminator to Minority Report, then hopes it would work or audience would suspend their belief. Story is the typical enhanced soldier theme. Granted, the video games used same narrative, but then it gets ridiculously over-the-top and even borderline supernatural. It follows Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) as he tries to find the scientist who pioneered the super soldier program by finding his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware).The movie revolves around finding this scientist and shady organization trying to revive the program. For a stoic character such as 47, the movie pairs him with female lead for more interaction, otherwise it'd be just all business and murder. It doesn't help that Katia is one dimensional and honestly equally stiff, the chemistry between them is hardly engaging.It's also odd that the multi-million organization and legendary assassins treats Katia as though she holds all the secret. The plot actually hinges entirely on her, and at times she even depicts as having clairvoyance skill. Script uses a lot of flamboyant one-liners, almost as in gibberish cat poster.With all of these quirky narrative and plot discrepancy, it's really hard to take the movie seriously. Story feels like a pretense to push the pace to next grand set pieces. To its credit, it does have plenty of stylish cinematography. Using all sorts of nifty choreography, dual wielding gunslinger combat in exotic places, it has ample bombastic action.Note that one of Hitman games actually titled Silent Assassin and it's also the highest rank in game. The cerebral or tactical approach is used sparsely, and those don't even appear natural. In fact, without the suit and Hitman on the title you wouldn't even recognize it as Hitman movie, probably some Universal Soldier spin-off. It's definitely an explosive spectacle, but sadly also a mindless one. If this is how video game is, still, translated to silver screen, it doesn't convey the game's core story, or any presentable story in general.",

            "review": "I thought I'd be hard pressed to see a film worse than Fantastic Four this year.In only one month, I have been proved wrong by Hitman Agent 47.We're shoved full steam through a rushed overview of the film's setting by a narrator for the first few minutes. It's meant to set the scene, but does little towards making the film we're about to see make any sense. This film is not about an assassin, it is barely even about the titular 47 at all in fact. For the majority of the film we follow a young woman, Katia, who has spent her whole life searching for a mysterious man.That really is all we're given to go on, as due to the truly awful plot, not much more makes sense. The man Katia seeks is her father, the creator of the secret project that created 47, but she doesn't know either of these details. So why or how she has spent her life searching for him is utterly a mystery, with no forthcoming explanation as the film goes on.Pursued by the over-aggressive Agent 47, and teaming up with a strange man who calls himself John Smith, the woman continues her search across the globe. When they aren't being shot at by 47, we're treated to some truly excruciating dialogue scenes between Katia and John, that just feel incredibly awkward. Katia spends the whole film with tears in her eyes for no reason, making her performance seem melodramatic, and John Smith is just plain one of the worst characters put to the screen this year. His dialogue is dull, his personality is non-existant, and everything is delivered by an apparently stoned Zachary Quinto in his worst role to date.47 pulls more face/heel turns than the Undertaker in the films first act, going from brooding, thoughtful hero to a bullet spraying maniac in minutes. Anyone who has played a Hitman game knows that it's about subtlety and subterfuge, the goal being for 47 to eliminate his targets with precision kills, and escaping entirely unseen. The 47 we see here has less subtlety than Anton Chigurh, pulling out his twin Berettas and blasting noisily away in every scene.After 47 and Katia team up to find her father, the film settles into an uneven pace of extreme, almost comedic violence and long boring scenes of tiring dialogue. How a film can spend so much time talking and still make no sense is beyond me. So much of the film's plot runs entirely on hunches and pure guess work that it seems none of these highly specialized characters really know what they're doing. By the time the film rolls to a climax, we've switched protagonists a few times, and we've barely seen the character who is meant to be the arch villain, and really never even get an idea of who he's even meant to be before our heroes confront him.There is so little enjoyable about this second adaptation of the popular video game series that it's really hard to know where to start. The protagonist, the titular 47, is soulless and devoid of personality, but not in the good way you expect from this character. His lines are wooden, and his wishy washy character simply doesn't make any sense. He's demanding his female ward to \"Trust me!\" in a desperate tone one scene, and then sadly sighing \"Don't put your faith in me.\" the next. We see none of the thoughtful, intellectual character here, and he frankly comes off as awkward throughout the whole film. To make matters worse, the actor taking the mantle of 47, Rupert Friend, is simply not intimidating in the role. His voice carries no weight, and his stature is neither imposing, not threatening. The character of 47 is meant to be a human apex predator, a perfect, precise killing machine. What we have here is a James Bond sidekick at best.Katia is an oddly soulless lead as well. A character who seems driven for no clear reason, with goals we never truly understand. She is said to have 'advanced survival abilities' which appear to manifest in the film as her literally seeing the future, and these abilities are continually used as a segway between scenes or get-out-of-awkward-situation free cards. Instead of it appearing like she's a character with advanced, inherent skills, it just seems supernatural, almost psychic in nature, and doesn't fit at all. There's even a baffling moment suggesting that Katia and 47 communicate telepathically that isn't remotely satisfactorily explained. The film can't quite decide if her story or 47's is the central one, so neither feel properly fleshed out, and her relationship to 47 is so thin and unconvincing, there's absolutely nothing to suggest she wouldn't switch alliances again at the drop of a hat.This is a film that insists upon mood with nothing to back it up, providing a facade of drama without any substance behind it. 47 or John Smith will have action scenes of such little interest or impact, backed up with a soundtrack that desperately suggests to you that the scene is cool. The same is true of several painful scenes of drama, where a sudden violin overture will kick in to remind you to switch from excitement to sadness, because the dialogue sure as hell isn't going to get you there. You'll notice dialogue exchanges lifted straight from other films, in fact.Hitman: Agent 47 boils down to an uninteresting and predictable climax, with little excitement along the way. The journey to the finale feels routine and genuinely uninspired, and the last scene is empty of any real feeling of satisfaction or resolution. There aren't loose ends, so to speak, just empty plot points. Why introduce 47's dispatcher at all if she never plays any significance on the plot whatsoever, and why does 47 disobey his orders without any reason? Why repeatedly show that Katia takes apart objects when she's bored, and never bring it back in the story? Unanswered questions that pull apart the integrity of the main characters make the whole thing feel like a half baked plan, a first draft that never saw another look.It's hard to make a good video game movie, we know this from the long history of tepid adaptations, but Hitman: Agent 47 is a poor excuse for an attempt in almost every way.",

Zachary Quinto was excellent but Rupert Friend shined as the the title character. I loved the spin of adding a female agent to the mix.

Rupert Friend makes a great Agent 47, but Zachery Quinto (Agent 17) makes the girl from the Godfather Part 3 look really good. The movie does have potential, but with a lack of good plot, this movie just makes the first one look better, and shows why movies based on video games just can't be made.

            "review": "This is a reboot of the failed 2007 movie based on the famous assassin stealth game franchise, starring Rupert Friend (replacing Paul Walker who had passed away) as the titular character, Hannah Ware, and Zachary Quinto. I'll be frank here: I've never played any of the Hitman games, so I can't say much as to how faithful this movie is to the game franchise, but I can tell you that it opens with a first act that's action-packed, intense, suspenseful, and smart, to the point where it reminded me of the Jason Bourne films (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). However, after a certain \"revelation\", the film's pace drops quite a bit during the 2nd act, and everything started to look \"video-gamey\"...by which I mean they seemed to dumb things down a lot, and tried to explain everything (with a little bit of character development thrown in), even at points where I felt it was unnecessary. By the climax towards the end, the action and pacing had picked up a little, albeit not to the level seen during the first act. The 3 main actors' performances were average, with Hannah Ware perhaps standing out a little bit more than the others. The end result is a film that is OK but rather unbalanced. I know a lot of people have their hopes up high for this film to be the first solid, credible video game movie to date; however, I can say that while we're not quite there yet, we're getting closer.

            "review": "Directed by first time feature film director Aleksander Bach, and based on IO Interactive's Hitman video game series, Hitman: Agent 47 is the second attempt by 20th Century Fox to bring the titular bald assassin clone to the big screen after the commercially successful 2007 film. To aid in rebooting the film after the critically panned first film, Agent 47 has the first Hitman film's hack screenwriter, Skip Woods, returning to provide the story and screenplay for this film, because that worked out well the first time.Loosely adapting elements from the video games, Woods primary focus remains on writing the action, as he forgoes narrative depth, character motivations and development in exchange for a chance to overwhelm the viewer's sensory with shooting, explosions and carnage. If the first Hitman film is of any indication, Hollywood does not understand how to translate a video game into a film. The usual approach involves ripping the spine out from a video game, and then using it as a prop in an action film. And it shows in this film, which was produced and co-written by Skip Woods, the brains behind such gems as X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), A Good Day to Die Hard (2013), and Sabotage (2014).As far removed from the silent assassin Agent 47 in the video games as possible, this film's Agent 47 - played by Rupert Friend - delights in obnoxiously showing his face to extras, all whilst blasting his way from one action set piece to another in a torrential hail of gunfire, while Friend's co-stars, Hannah Ware and Zachary Quinto, force performances out of what little material there is to work with. Even if Marco Beltrami's composition is a worthy alternative to Jesper Kyd's iconic orchestral, electronic scoring from the video games, strip away any superficial resemblance to IO Interactive's acclaimed stealth video game series (the character, the codename, the suit, the agency), and what is left behind is a mangled ghoul, intent on prancing around in the skin and suit of the iconic Agent 47.Wedged in the exit wounds left by the action sequences, director Bach's background in music videos is plentiful, as he captures the slick aesthete from Berlin to Singapore's Gardens by the Bay, and beyond the isolated instances that display 47's prowess in planning ahead, along with the semi-coherent close-quarters combat - owing to John Wick's David Leitch - despite the gratuitous shaky camera effect and jump cuts, Hitman: Agent 47 simply isn't a fun action caper, as much as \"fun\" is an overused, repetitive, stale adjective in describing a film. For fans, there is nothing 'fun' in watching an iconic stealthy character engage in a shootout in broad daylight in the middle of a city. For casual cinema patrons, there is nothing 'fun' about Agent 47, because everything it attempts to do as an action blockbuster, every other blockbuster this summer has delivered tenfold.Lacking the theatrical, operatic, dark nuance of its source material, the film is yet another loud, cacophonous live-action adaptation of a beloved video game series that is naturally beset by the malady of Hollywood bastardization, twisting the source material into a bloated, inartistic monstrosity. In the skillful hands of a screenwriter and a director with a passion for the source material, a Hitman film could be an electrifying thriller, as 47 looms in the shadows, silently creeping through each scene in various disguises hunting for his prey, or as an introspective look into the traditionally cold, morally grey character. But alas, the generic Hitman: Agent 47 lacks the intelligence to be anything more than a trite shoot 'em up.",

            "review": "Not that bad.Well, this is certainly an improvement from the 2007 version but I wouldn't quickly say 'they finally got it right' just yet. I will say this, however, HITMAN: AGENT 47 makes me think that there's hope after all for game-based movies. It's entertaining at best.After the 2007 Xavier Gens-directed film starring Timothy Olyphant as agent 47, with a very weak story masked with pointless and poorly staged action sequences, the idea of revisiting this just wasn't appealing, especially with the casting of Rupert Friend who I think holds his own in \"Homeland\" series but I had my doubts if Friend could pull this off. I forgot that it really doesn't take much to play Agent 47, he's the guy who's supposed to not express feelings or emotions, so HITMAN: AGENT 47's story is quite simple, there's a mega-corporation that wants to start an agent program again. This relentless killing machine, Agent 47, who was the result of such program, wants to stop it from happening and he teams up with a young woman who holds the secret, and together they confront their past, their origins and ultimately their greatest foe.There's a little bit of \"Terminator\"s 'come with me if you want to live' aspect here, not to mention that Zachary Quinto's villainous character has been injected with some kind of liquid metal body armor that makes him invincible. And I also find it amusing that this movie has its own 'syndicate' since we're fresh off watching \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\" Because HITMAN: AGENT 47 story is simple and formulaic and because it doesn't take much for Rupert Friend to play our hero, the questions now lies in how effective are the the action sequences and to a certain extent, they are, this movie's R-rated, so nothing is sacred, Agent 47 will aim for the head any chance he gets. But there are some sequences that aren't quite well-tied together, they're not quite well-explained, for example how one shot be at one place one second and then end up on that other corner the next second, and I think they're done for the sake of giving you an image of this much stealthier and stronger agent 47, but those sequences do come across as lazy or cop out at times. HITMAN: AGENT 47 is not perfect, but I think it's a decent enough start for the studio to plan a sequel instead of pressing the reboot button again. Please read more at Ramascreen.Com",
